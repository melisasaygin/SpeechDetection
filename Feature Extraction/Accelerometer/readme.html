#For using the model to perform speech detection, only the z-axis (sagittal) accelerometer (df_acc_z) data is needed as all features required by the Acc model are all from this sensor and the others
#are not needed.
#The raw data of the participant for the other sensors (accelerometer in the y axis, accelerometer in the x axis, gyroscope in axes x, y, z) are provided for transparency. The same script can be used to extract the
#features for these sensors, if wanted.
