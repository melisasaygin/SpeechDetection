#Only the RIPThoraxFeatureExtraction.ipynb features are needed for the ThoraxRIP model. The RIPAbdomenFeatureExtraction.ipynb is there to illustrate the
#feature extraction process used in the paper for training the 2bands RIP model. 
#If one specifically wants to use the 2bands RIP method, they would need to extract both thorax and abdomen features, and combine them in one sheet (.xlsx).
